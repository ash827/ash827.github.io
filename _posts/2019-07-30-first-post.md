Hello! My name is Ashley Eddings, and I am recently started learning Data Science through Lambda School's Online Data Science Program. This is an account of my journey as I stumble and have breakthrough moments as a newbie to the coding world! I hope you have as much fun as I do, and I look forward to looking back on these posts as I gain more knowledge and expertise in the field of data science.
